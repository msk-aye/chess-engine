Chess Engine
----------------
Trying to make a simple working chess engine that is able to beat me and my friend (rated about 1200) in chess.

I will be trying to take as little external input as possible, includign reading on how chess engines work, how they prune branches etc. This will surely result in a very inefficient and possibly broken engine, but I hope that I can make something at least good enough to beat me and my friend.

game_environment.py - An instance of a chess game, with peices and possible moves
game_state.py - Unsure if this is really needed but will keep for now
engine.py - Where the magic happens (hopefully)
